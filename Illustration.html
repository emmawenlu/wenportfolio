<h3>Personal Sigil</h3>
<h4>This project, we need to research the history of a group. It could be our family, a fictional family, or a close personal friends.<br>
Use that research to create a coat of arms-style collection of symbols in a vectorized form; we would refer to this as a sigil.<br>
After we finish sigils, also need to do 3 mockups.<br>
This Sigil inspires by my hometown-Qingdao where I was born from. It is a beautiful costal city with the sea on three sides<br>
 has abundant maritime resources. Dolphin symbolizes peace, smart and be nice to people. <br>
 You can see there are couple icons surround the outline
They are characters of a dynasty and it means different weather. <br>
Weather could be represent different personalities of people. <br>
That's why I use these elements to be my family member
